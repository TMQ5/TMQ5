        "### We observe the following from this Summary Statistical Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **satisfaction_level**: The satisfaction level ranges between 9% and 100%, with an average satisfaction level of 61%. This indicates a moderate level of overall employee satisfaction. Higher satisfaction levels are typically associated with increased productivity, lower turnover rates, and better overall workplace morale.\n",
        "- **last_evaluation**: The last evaluation score ranges between 36% and 100%, with an average score of 72%. This indicates that, on average, employees perform well according to their evaluations. High evaluation scores could suggest effective performance management and a high level of employee competence.\n",
        "- **number_project**: The number of projects worked on ranges between 2 and 7, with an average of 3.8 projects. This suggests that employees typically handle about 4 projects on average, indicating a moderate workload. Managing multiple projects can impact employee performance and satisfaction, depending on the support and resources available.\n",
        "- **average_montly_hours**: The average monthly hours worked range between 96 and 310, with an average of 201 hours. This suggests that employees, on average, work more than the typical full-time hours. High average monthly hours could indicate a demanding work environment, which might affect employee satisfaction and work-life balance.\n",
        "- **time_spend_company**: The time spent in the company ranges between 2 and 10 years, with an average of 3.5 years. This means that, on average, employees stay with the company for 3.5 years. A longer average tenure can indicate higher employee satisfaction and stability, while a shorter tenure may suggest issues with employee retention or job satisfaction.\n",
        "- **Work_accident**: The work accident indicator ranges between 0% and 100%, with an average of 14%. This means that, on average, 14% of employees experienced work-related accidents. A high accident rate may indicate the need for improved safety measures and training within the company to ensure a safer work environment.\n",
        "- **left**: The employee turnover indicator ranges between 0% and 100%, with an average of 24%. This means that, on average, 24% of employees left the company within the measured period. A high turnover rate can be indicative of issues within the company such as low job satisfaction, limited career advancement opportunities, or unfavorable working conditions.\n",
        "- **promotion_last_5years**: The promotion in the last 5 years indicator ranges between 0% and 100%, with an average of 2%. This low average indicates that promotions are rare within the company, which could negatively affect employee motivation and retention if employees feel there are limited opportunities for advancement.\n",
        "- **salary_numeric**: The salary level ranges between 1 and 3, with an average level of 1.6. This average indicates that the general salary level is closer to the lower end of the scale, with most employees having a salary level of either 1 (low) or 2 (medium)."

Employees involved in a higher number of projects tend to have better performance scores, suggesting that increased workload, within reasonable limits, can be associated with higher performance.

        "#### Findings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Number of Projects:**\n",
        "   - **Correlation**: A positive correlation (0.35) was found between the number of projects and employee performance. Employees involved in a higher number of projects tend to receive higher performance evaluations.\n",
        "   - **Hypothesis Testing**: The hypothesis test revealed a statistically significant difference in performance evaluations between employees who work on fewer projects versus those who work on more projects (T-statistic: -35.14, P-value: 4.43e-260).\n",
        "   - **Conclusion**: Increasing the number of projects assigned to employees could enhance their performance, provided that the workload is manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Average Monthly Hours:**\n",
        "   - **Correlation**: There is a positive correlation between average monthly hours worked and employee performance.\n",
        "   - **Hypothesis Testing**: The hypothesis test showed a statistically significant difference in performance evaluations between employees who work fewer monthly hours versus those who work more (T-statistic: -37.16, P-value: 3.65e-289).\n",
        "   - **Conclusion**: Employees who work more hours on average tend to have better performance evaluations. Ensuring employees are engaged for sufficient hours without overworking them can improve performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Time Spent at the Company:**\n",
        "   - **Correlation**: A significant relationship exists between the time spent at the company and employee performance.\n",
        "   - **Hypothesis Testing**: The hypothesis test indicated a statistically significant difference in performance evaluations between employees with shorter tenures versus those with longer tenures at the company (T-statistic: -30.90, P-value: 2.36e-203).\n",
        "   - **Conclusion**: Employees with more years at the company generally perform better. Strategies to retain employees longer could lead to improved performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Satisfaction Level:**\n",
        "   - **Correlation**: There is a positive correlation between employee satisfaction levels and their performance evaluations.\n",
        "   - **Hypothesis Testing**: The hypothesis test showed a statistically significant difference in performance evaluations between employees with lower satisfaction levels versus those with higher satisfaction levels (T-statistic: -25.24, P-value: 8.80e-138).\n",
        "   - **Conclusion**: Higher satisfaction levels among employees are associated with better performance. Efforts to improve job satisfaction can lead to enhanced employee performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Recommendations:\n",
        "- **Project Management**: Ensure a balanced and manageable number of projects per employee to optimize performance.\n",
        "- **Work Hours**: Monitor and adjust work hours to ensure employees are engaged but not overworked, to maintain high performance.\n",
        "- **Retention Strategies**: Develop and implement retention strategies to encourage longer tenures, which positively impact performance.\n",
        "- **Satisfaction Programs**: Invest in programs and initiatives to enhance employee satisfaction, leading to better performance outcomes."
